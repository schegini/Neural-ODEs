# Neural-ODEs Analysis

### A Brief Overview

This paper is meant to explore Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and apply them to a classic example problem. The NODE is benchmarked against an analytical solution, and we compare the dynamics learned by a neural network to the real dynamics. Overall, it is demonstrated that NODEs can accurately approximate and reconstruct continuous systems from discrete data.
